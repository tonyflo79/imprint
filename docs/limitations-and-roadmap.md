# Limitations and Roadmap

## Current limits

- Claude Code hook payloads and lifecycle behavior can change upstream. Hook
  failures are visible and must be revalidated against new Claude Code releases.
- The default retrieval budget is byte-based and deterministic, not a promise of
  an exact model-token count.
- Canonical SQLite is single-writer. Unsynchronized shared writers are refused;
  this release is not a collaborative database service.
- Cold-start input still requires conservative operator review. A source being
  parseable does not make it authoritative.
- Digest generation and profile learning are experimental, disabled by default,
  and not part of the stable acceptance claim.
- Optional graph adapters are portability conveniences. Local SQLite remains the
  authority.
- The ontology can store ZMOS/self-model, chosen-direction, business observation,
  confidence, calibration, consent, and outcome records now. Automatic ZMOS,
  Operating Portrait, Mirror Score, and intervention engines are not included.
- No software can guarantee that sensitive data is safe on a compromised host.

## Explicit non-claims

This release does not passively observe screens, reconstruct unspoken intent, or
capture decisions from Screenpipe. Screenpipe-assisted observation is roadmap
research only. Imprint does not fabricate a missing reason, infer authorship as
fact, or silently promote imported or inferred material.

## Roadmap

- Opt-in Screenpipe candidate capture with explicit consent, content boundaries,
  provenance receipts, and a complete privacy/retention threat model.
- Stable digest resolution and profile-learning lifecycles after longitudinal
  evidence and uninstall/recovery coverage exist.
- Automatic Operating Portrait synthesis, Mirror Score scenarios, drift/fossil
  alerts, and real-time sabotage intervention over the shipped typed records.
- A networked Neo4j connector layered over the shipped offline generic/Atlas
  projections, with provider-specific integration fixtures.
- Additional hook-provider adapters that preserve the same recorder/compiler
  separation.
